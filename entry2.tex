\textit{``The question what is a body, is the question what is it to eat: Take, eat; this is my body.''}(Brown) \\


For this journal entry I wanted to look at how society is viewing womens bodies in Nervous Conditions
``You've got a waist. One of these days you'll have a bust. Pity about the backside, ... It's rather large  ''[91]
``Shes probably dieting because I told her her bottom is fat''[92]

``nyasha fell on to the bed, her miniscule skirt riding up to her bottom''[114]
``Lucia had somehow managed to keep herself plump despite her tribulations''[127]

Colonialism puts womens bodies in a constant state of contradiction  - plump but not fat... etc.
