This was inspired by my classmate 

The woman in the intro using her body as a weapon compared to the men using their bodies as a weapon in Paradise Now. 

I found the intro to Paradise Now being interesting because the woman is dressed in very form-fitting and accentuating clothing. This immediately clashes with the guards, military, masculine clothing. Immediately - the viewer is clued into the conflict and in particular conflict that feels `inherent' in some way.  

Continuing to look at the topless women in Everything must Fall. The idea of the feminine body as a weapon is an interesting idea. Returning to the definition, we can see body as a corpse and so to bare ones body is to bare ones corpse. The idea of conflict being something that creates corpses then it can be inferred to create a body (perhaps by going topless) is to escalate to conflict, or to make yourself the corpse; in the fall this illustrates the violence of the police.
