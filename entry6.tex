The requirement of the blowjob in TLATOMK

I was shocked (as I think everyone was) by the sexual assault at the end of The Life and Times of Micheal K. There is a lot to say about this, but from a body perspective, the first thing I thought when reading this was along the lines of `Wow - the whole time K. has been described as sexless and stated he wasn't even interested in women. this seems like a big change' 

``In oral copulation the vagina is a devouring mouth.
 The combined object (parents in coitus) becomes the
 mother with a penis. The father is castrated; the mother
 retains his penis. "The horrible woman who thrusts her
 long nose into the room through the window at night
 to alarm the cobbler is clearly the dream apparition of
 the old woman with a penis, that is the primal scene in
 the abbreviated form of the combined parent.''

 ``Oral copulation, or the equation of penis and breast,
 the crux in sexual inversion. Coitus as castration. To be
 castrated is to be a woman; but the woman is a devouring
 mouth which castrates. Those who have been castrated
 must castrate others to incorporate their penis; but to receive into themselves a penis is again to be a woman, to
 be castrated. The solution to the castration-complex is
 genital organization. But genital organization is the basic
 equation of body (self) and penis; and "the sexual aim
 of a person who has in phantasy eaten the penis and be
come the penis isâ€”to be eaten."''
