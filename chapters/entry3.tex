I found the intro to Paradise Now being interesting because the woman is dressed in very form-fitting and accentuating clothing. This immediately clashes with the guards, military, masculine clothing. Immediately - the viewer is clued into the conflict and in particular conflict that feels `inherent' (at least to our gendered eyes) in some way. Continuing the body as a weapon we see the men using theirs as literal weapons.  

Continuing to look at the topless women in Everything must Fall. The idea of the feminine body as a weapon is an interesting idea. Returning to the definition, we can see body as a corpse and so to bare ones body is to bare ones corpse. To view the idea of conflict being something that creates corpses then it can be inferred that to be in conflict is to create a body; thus to create a body (perhaps by going topless) is to escalate to conflict, or to make yourself a corpse. Additionally by viewing sex namely, copulation, as the creation of body then we can continue the act of going topless, (which is viewed socially as sexual) as an escalation to sex and so an escalation to the creation of a body  -- a corpse.
